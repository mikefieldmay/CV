I'm a full-stack junior developer and a recent graduate of [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

Learning to code at Europe's leading bootcamp has completely changed my life. I've been imbued with a new sense of confidence, a devotion to clean, tested, and re-usable code, and a passion to continue to develop my skills. I have a firm belief that software and technology will help solve the countless problems that the world is currently facing and I feel incredibly privileged that I'm going to be a part of that.

I bring a high level of positivity and enthusiasm to any new challenge that I face. I can quickly break down a problem into its constituent parts and I love the satisfaction of ironing out difficult bugs.

I want a job in which I can continue to learn and grow my skills as a software engineer using the best practices I've learnt at Makers.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Problem solving**: I have always enjoyed logic and puzzles and working as an IT technician I relied heavily on my problem solving skills. Before any issues could be solved I would have to determine what the problem was at its most basic level and then apply a resolution based on the most likely fix.
- **Communication**: When I provided first line IT support people would often call in an agitated state. I would diffuse the situation and provide them with reassurance that there was a solution. Customers had varied technical competency so I would have to adapt explanations of IT issues and solutions. Whilst explaining issues to colleagues I needed to be precise and clear.
- **Working under pressure**: As an IT technician I was often working under high pressure. Businesses may have had issues that completely stop them from functioning and as such there was a lot of pressure to get the issue resolved. Regular jobs also had an element of pressure as the support service was charged per hour customers would often scrutinise your methods whilst  fixing problems.
- **Team work**: I frequently become a strong motivational force in the groups I work in. Whilst working on the multiplayer card game Pixos, our final project at Makers academy, we had undertaken a lot of new technologies with an ambitious end goal. On a few occasions our goal seemed unattainable, but my teammates often commented that my positive attitude encouraged them to continue and we ended up with an incredible end product.
- **Fast learner**: Before beginning my time as an IT technician I hadn't had any formal IT training After my first month I was already adding value to the company as I was confidently able to visit customers in order to resolve the problems that they had.

## <a name="projects">Projects</a>

| Project | Summary | Technologies | Successes | Struggled with |
|----------|----------|----------|--------- | ------- |
|[Marvel Covers](https://github.com/mikefieldmay/MarvelCovers)| After spending time learning Angular on a Udemy course I decide to apply it to a practice project to cement my learning| Angular Cli, rxjs, Typescript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. Hosted on AWS.  **Testing**: Jasmine, Karma and Protractor.| Whilst I'm still working on the UI adn implementing further features, the project is fully tested and the interface looks pretty good. A considerable amount of time was spent on the HTML and CSS side of the project. [Project Link](http://ng-marvel-covers-app.s3-website.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/)| Testing in any new framework is initially very difficult, but now I have the hang of it, it should be easier in future. The Marvel API didn't return waht I had expected it to and not everything it returns is uniform, but this gave me good practice at handling data.| 
|[Pixos](https://github.com/bvjones/Pixos)| In our final project we created a browser based strategy card game based on Gwent from the video game The Witcher 3. | Mongodb, Express, React.js, Node.js, Redux, Socket.io, Webpack, Enzyme, Bootstrap and Material-UI. **Testing**: Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Enzyme. | In a short amount of time we managed to create an exciting card game and achieve all of the ambitious goals that we set ourselves. It'll be a project that I continue to contribute to long after I finish Makers| Working with so many new technologies and understanding how they all came together initially proved very difficult. |
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/mikefieldmay/tech_test_bank)| As part of our practice Tech tests we were asked to create a bank.  | Ruby. **Testing**: Rspec. | Because of careful planning I was able to approach the test in an object oriented manner. | I managed to get all the basic functionality unit tested and working, but lacked the time to run any feature tests on the project.|
| [Noughts and Crosses](https://github.com/mikefieldmay/https://github.com/mikefieldmay/tech_test_noughts_and_crosses)| As part of our practice Tech tests we were asked to create a noughts and crosses game. | Javascript, Jquery, HTML, Sass and Bootstrap. **Testing**: Jasmine. | I approached this challenge in an object oriented manner. I was able to test most of the basic functionality before I had created the interface for the game. | The game works well for two players, but it would have been great to create a single player version. This version has a 3x3 board size limit too and it would be difficult to increase the board size the way it has currently been written. |
