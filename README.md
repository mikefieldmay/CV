I'm a former IT technician with a love of problem solving and a passion for creating things. After dabbling with HTML and CSS I realised that coding was the career I always wanted, but didn't know existed.   
I'm about to kickstart my career by studying at Makers Academy,  Europe's leading web development bootcamp.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

- **Problem solving**: I have always enjoyed logic and puzzles and working as an IT technician I relied heavily on my problem solving skills. Before any issues could solved I would have to determine what the problem was at its most basic level and then apply a resolution based on the most likely fix.
- **Communication**: When I provided first line IT support people would often call in an agitated state. I would diffuse the situation and provide them with reassurance that there was a solution. Customers had varied technical competency so I would have to adapt explanations of IT issues and solutions. Whilst explaining issues to colleagues I needed to be precise and clear.
- **Working under pressure**: As an IT technician I was often working under high pressure. Businesses may have had issues that completely stop them from functioning and as such there was a lot of pressure to get the issue resolved. Regular jobs also had an element of pressure as the support service was charged per hour customers would often scrutinise your methods whilst  fixing problems.
- **Fast learner**: Before beginning my time as an IT technician I hadn't had any formal IT training, but after my first month I was confidently able to visit customers in order to resolve the problems that they had.

| Project | Summary | Technologies | Successes | Struggled with |
|----------|----------|----------|--------- | ------- |
|[Pixos](https://github.com/mikefieldmay/Pixos)| In our final project we created a browser based strategy card game based on Gwent from the video game The Witcher 3. | Mongodb, Express, React.js, Node.js, Redux, Socket.io, Webpack, Enzyme, Bootstrap and Material-UI. **Testing**: Mocha, Chai, Sinon, Enzyme. | In a short amount of time we managed to create an exciting card game and achieve all of the ambitious goals that we set ourselves. It'll be a project that I continue to contribute to long after I finish Makers| Working with so many new technologies and understanding how they all came together initially proved very difficult. |
|[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/mikefieldmay/tech_test_bank)| As part of our practice Tech tests we were asked to create a bank.  | Ruby. **Testing**: Rspec. | I felt that because of the planning I did I was able to approach the test in an object oriented manner. | I managed to get all the basic functionality unit tested and working, but lacked the time to run any feature tests on the project.|
| [Makers BnB](https://github.com/mikefieldmay/makersbnb)| One of our weekly challenges at Makers was to create a clone of the popular rental website Air BnB | Ruby, Javascript, Heroku, Sinatra, HTML, Sass and Bootstrap. **Testing**: Rspec. | Managing to stay agile in our first group project and sticking to the best practices taught at Makers | Because it was the first week that we were given just a broad outline of the challenge it was initially difficult to work out where to start. |
